## Process

- Started first by defining the component hierachy of the app.
- Once we established `<QuestionContainer/>` as the parent container component that would hold all of our quiz components we divided the labour of building these child components.
- In cases where the component relied on data gathered by others, dummy data was used to start building the logic.
- These child components were passed information as props from `</QuestionContainer>` in the form of data or methods.
- When good progress was made on these components, we started styling and developing tests for these components.
- We also took a behavioural approach to building functionality and styling - making iterations based on the behaviour of the app and user experience.
